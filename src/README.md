This directory contains the actual source code of the project.

It is split in three sub-directories :

- `tool/` contains the entry point of the program and everything related to the command-line interface, it defines the `ono` executable;
- `lib/` is where you will have to make most of your changes, it defines the `ono` library (which is used by the executable);
- `kdo/` contains the `kdo` library, you should not change it but you must use it, it provides a lot of things needed for the project that I wrote for you.
